mark
====

A simple Ruby script to draw a stripe across your terminal, marking a clear "line in the sand."


Installation
------------

Clone the repository and alias mark.rb in your shell. My .bashrc alias looks like this:

    if [ -x /Users/mlambie/Source/mark/mark.rb ]; then
      alias mark='/Users/mlambie/Source/mark/mark.rb'
    fi

Adjust your file path accordingly.
